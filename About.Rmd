## Goal

Perfoming advance bioinformatics analysis of next-generation sequencing data and metadata

## Products

All pipelines and other scripts, software and programs generated in this course will be added to a public GitHub repository designed for that purpose.

A manuscript outlining the design and usage of the software tools constructed by each team may be submitted to an appropriate journal, such as the F1000Research Hackathons channel.

## Notes

Participants will need to bring their own laptop to this program.

A working knowledge of scripting (e.g., Shell, Python) is necessary to be successful in this event. Employment of higher level scripting or programming languages may also be useful.

Applicants must be willing to commit to all three days of the event.

No financial support for travel, lodging or meals is available for this event.
